# B3950ThermistorArduino
This repo contains B3950 NTC 10K Thermistor Library for Arduino.

The precision 10K thermistor is an inexpensive way to measure temperature in a small gap, or taped to a flat surface, it's only 0.2mm wide!
The resistance in 25Â°C is 10K (+- 1%). The resistance goes down as it gets warmer and goes up as it gets cooler.
