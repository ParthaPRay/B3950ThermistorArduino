# B3950ThermistorArduino
This repo contains B3950 NTC 10K Thermistor Library for Arduino.

The precision 10K thermistor is an inexpensive way to measure temperature in a small gap, or taped to a flat surface, it's only 0.2mm wide!
The resistance in 25°C is 10K (+- 1%). The resistance goes down as it gets warmer and goes up as it gets cooler.

# Raw Code for B3950 for Arduino

B3950_Raw.ino file contains the raw code to measure resistance (kOhm), temperature (celcius and fahrenheit) as per the datasheet provided by Adafruit as mentioned in the temperature-to-resistance lookup table https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/103_3950_lookuptable.pdf
